# Glucose Level Forecasting

This project uses deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, CNN) to predict glucose levels from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data.  
It’s designed as a Jupyter notebook so you can explore the data, train models, and see results interactively.

## 🚀 How to Get Started

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/glucose-forecasting.git
   cd glucose-forecasting
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**
   - All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
   - Install them with:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Unzip the dataset**
   - Inside the `data/` folder there is a file `dataset.zip`.  
   - Before running the notebook, unzip it:
     ```bash
     unzip data/dataset.zip -d data/
     ```
   - After unzipping, the raw data will be ready in `data/`.

4. **Run the notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook glucose_forecasting_models.ipynb
   ```

## 📝 Notes
- If you’re using Google Colab, upload the extracted `data/` folder before running the notebook.  
- The notebook includes model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.

## 🤖 Models You’ll Find Here
- **LSTM** — learns long-term dependencies in glucose sequences.  
- **GRU** — simpler and faster than LSTM but still strong for time series.  
- **CNN** — captures short-term glucose spikes and rapid changes.  

Each model is compared so you can see which one works best for short-term glucose forecasting.
